        <p>E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling products on online services or over the Internet. 
        E-commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online
         transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. E-commerce

 in the title and text of California's Electronic Commerce Act, carried by the late Committee Chairwoman Gwen Moore (D-L.A.) and enacted in 1984.
